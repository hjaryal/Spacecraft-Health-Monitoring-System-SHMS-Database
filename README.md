# Spacecraft-Health-Monitoring-System-SHMS-Database
This database project prioritizes monitoring and maintaining spacecraft health during space flights, emphasizing real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and comprehensive logging for overall mission success, safety, and efficiency.

In this database project, several key tables have been designed to address critical aspects of spacecraft health monitoring and maintenance.
1.	SystemStatus Table: The SystemStatus table serves as the core entity for tracking the overall health of spacecraft systems. With attributes like SystemID, SystemType, Status, Timestamp, and Description, it provides a comprehensive overview, enabling continuous monitoring of critical systems in a space mission.
2.	Metrics Table: The Metrics table records detailed parameters associated with specific spacecraft components. Attributes such as MetricID, SystemID, MetricName, MeasuredValue, Unit, and Timestamp allow for granular analysis of individual system parameters, supporting an in-depth understanding of system performance.
3.	MaintenanceLogs Table: MaintenanceLogs table captures all maintenance activities on spacecraft systems. With attributes like LogID, SystemID, Description, Timestamp, MaintenanceType, and TechnicianID, it contributes to proactive maintenance strategies and serves as a historical record of maintenance activities.
4.	Alerts Table: The Alerts table generates alerts based on thresholds for critical metrics from the Metrics table. Attributes including AlertID, SystemID, MetricID, AlertType, ThresholdValue, Timestamp, and AcknowledgmentStatus. It will facilitate the identification of potential issues and quick decision-making for immediate resolution.
5.	Actions Table: The Actions table documents responses to generated alerts from the alert table. With attributes such as ActionID, AlertID, ActionType, Timestamp, and Description, it provides a traceable history of actions taken, contributing to post-mission analysis, and improving future space missions.
6.	Technician Table: The Technician table maintains information about technicians involved in spacecraft maintenance. Attributes like TechnicianID, FirstName, LastName, ContactNumber, Email, and Specialization allow for association with specific maintenance logs, contributing to a more detailed understanding of maintenance activities.
